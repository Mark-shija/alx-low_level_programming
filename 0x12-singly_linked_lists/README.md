* In this project I learned the concept of Data, Data structure and Algorithim.

> A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

# Data Structure Analogy
* Data structures, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand. If data is a plate of food, data structures are your utensils (algorithms would be how to effectively use those utensils in this analogy). Just as you will likely select a spoon to eat a bowl of soup rather than a knife, you will learn over time to select and properly use data structures which fit the nature of the data you are working with.
